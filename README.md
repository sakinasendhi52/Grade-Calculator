<h3>2. Additional Comments on Grade</h3>
<p>Extend the program to provide additional comments based on the grade using a switch-case statement. 
For example, if the grade is 'A', then print 'Excellent work!'. If the grade is 'B', then print 'Well done'.
If the grade is 'C', then print 'Good job'. If the grade is 'D', then print 'You passed, but you could do better'.
And if the grade is 'F', then print 'Sorry, you failed'.</p>

<h3>3. Eligibility Check from Grade</h3>
<p>Further, extend the program to checck eligibility for the next level based on the grade
using an if-else statement. Print 'Congratulations! You are eligible for the next level' if the
grade is from 'A' to 'D'. Print 'Please try again next time' if the grade is 'F'.</p>
